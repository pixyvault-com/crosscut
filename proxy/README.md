proxy (mole?)
=============

This is a cloud service written in async Rust.

What kind of connections does it handle?

 * register server
   - persists a push-notification identifier (e.g. APNS device token) for this server

 * register TOTP secret
   - persists a TOTP secret, generated by the server, associating a client (by email or phone#) with
     that server

 * pseudo-push-notification backchannel
   - long-lived TCP connection from server; replaces "real" push notification mechanisms when the server is actively running

 * proxy
   - perform TOTP 2fa before involving the server, using our shared secret, if necessary (new or expired)
   - send push notification to server with an inverter endpoint

 * inverter
   - connect the inverter session to the proxy session
