server
 - publish a file
   - register file at a path
 - share a published file
   - sms or email, sent directly by user
   - ultimately this is just a url, pointing to the proxy
   - oob: generate and send a TOTP secret to the proxy to 2fa the client
 - receive background push notification
   - open connection to the proxy
   - wire up an http server

proxy
 - respond to file url
   - url contains identifier of the server
     - (check for paid user here I guess?)
   - we can use the oob 
   - can we perform client auth *before* involving the server? (is there client auth??)
   - send a background push notification to the server
   - await incoming connection from the server
   - plug client into server (just http/2?)

client
 - fetch a file url
   - just an http client??
